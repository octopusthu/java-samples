# Spring Boot Scheduled Tasks Sample

## Default pool size

Verifies that the default thread pool size for Spring Boot scheduled tasks is 1.

First, run `SpringBootScheduledTasksSampleApplication` without
specifying `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size`. Only one task should be running:

```text
Task one is running...
Task one is running...
Task one is running...
Task one is running...
```

Then, specify `spring.task.scheduling.pool.size=2` and run the application again. Now the two tasks
are both running:

```text
Task one is running...
Task two is running...
Task one is running...
Task two is running...
```
